# Notes on Slides

Visit the slides created by this repository at https://amajor.github.io/notes-slides/

These slides make use of [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com).

## Run it Locally

It can be helpful to run these slides locally for viewing. 


For simple slides formatted within [index.html](./index.html), you merely need
to open [index.html](./index.html) in your browser from your local clone of 
the repository.

However, if you are using external Markdown files, you'll need to run a server.
See [./docs/server.md](./docs/server.md) for more information on installing
these dependencies.

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
